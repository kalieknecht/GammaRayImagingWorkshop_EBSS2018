    "It is important to have a clear idea of the \"experiment\" that was used to generate the data. We have modelled the gamma-ray imager after a planar HPGe imaging system known as the Volumetric Compton Imager (VCI): it consists of two square-faced planar HPGe detectors that are 74 mm wide and 15 mm thick. The two planar detectors are parallel and separated by a gap of 10 mm. Note that this simple model only contains the HPGe detectors and does not include any of the surrounding material (cryostat, front-ends, etc), so the simulation will not account for scattering effects outside of the detector volumes.\n",

    "\n",
    "A gamma-ray **interaction** describes a single physical process that the gamma-ray undergoes. Compton scattering, photoelectric absorption, and pair production are the three common ionizing gamma-ray interaction types of interest for gamma-ray spectroscopy and imaging. Each interaction is described by an 3D location where the interaction took place (in the coordinate frame shown above), as well as the energy deposited by the gamma-ray in the interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "A gamma-ray **event** consists of all of the interactions that are undergone by a particular gamma-ray as it passes through the detector. For example, a gamma-ray with incident energy of 1 MeV may interact with a detector by Compton scattering three times within the sensitive volume, and finally be absorbed via photoelectric absorption. The gamma-ray event is composed of the four interactions of the gamma-ray in the detector. Note that only interactions that occur within the sensitive volume of the detector are considered as part of the event!\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these definitions, we can finally start working with the data. The `InteractionData` field contains information about individual interactions in the detector, while the `EventPointers` and `EventLengths` describe how the interactions are organized into events. Each value in the `EventPointers` is an integer that points to the index in the `InteractionData` array that indicates the start of an event. The corresponding value in the `EventLengths` array describes how many interactions constitute the event. The following cell gives an example of how to load the `n-th` event from the data arrays."
