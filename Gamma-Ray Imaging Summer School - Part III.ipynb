    "In the previous lesson, we succeeded in applying a simple Compton backprojection algorithm to create Compton images. If you have ever seen a Compton image before, you were probably surprised at how well the point source was recovered using only a simple backprojection algorithm. This is because we have been using *perfect* simulated data; i.e. we had ignored how the *detector response* impacts the collected data, and ultimately the imaging.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to keep in mind that these exercises are very superficial and designed only to provide a tangible example of how real-world issues affect gamma-ray imaging systems. In reality, detector responses are far more complex than the simple models we will use, and there are many other factors that are neither captured nor even considered here. That being said, simple analyses like these are often valuable in providing basic insight and order-of-magnitude estimates for effects that you may encounter in true imaging applications."
